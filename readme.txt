Shortcode Usage:

* `[ bns_theme_details ]` - this is the default (less the spaces) which will display the current active theme on the site (provided it is hosted on the WordPress repository).

Shortcode parameters (and their defaults):

* `title => __return_null()` ... returns nothing

* `show_rating => true` ... displays the current "star" rating of the theme
* `show_number_of_ratings => true` ... displays the number of ratings the theme has received
