Shortcode Usage:

* `[ bns_theme_details ]` - this is the default (less the spaces) which will display the current active theme on the site (provided it is hosted on the WordPress repository).

Shortcode parameters (and their defaults):

* `title => __return_null()` ... returns nothing
* `theme_slug => wp_get_theme()->get_template()` ... uses the current theme; the theme name can also be used in place of its slug provided they are similar
* `use_screenshot_link => true` ... displays main screenshot
* `show_name => true` ... displays the theme name
* `show_author => true` ... displays the author name
* `show_last_updated => true` ... displays when the theme was last updated
* `show_current_version => true` ... displays the current theme version
* `show_rating => true` ... displays the current "star" rating of the theme
* `show_number_of_ratings => true` ... displays the number of ratings the theme has received
* `show_description => true` ... displays theme description (this is false by default in the widget section)
* `show_downloaded_count => true` ... displays the total download count
* `use_download_link => true` ... displays a download link pointing to the current version of the theme in the WordPress Theme repository
* `show_changelog => true` ... displays the contents of the theme's `changelog.txt` file if it exists
